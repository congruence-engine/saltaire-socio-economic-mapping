# Saltaire socio-economic mapping


## Short summary
Saltaire is a model village north of Bradford, created to house the workers in Titus Salt’s textile mill. As such, it could be expected to provide a better standard of living, and a greater social cohesion than the unplanned urban sprawl of the overpopulated cities of the industrial revolution. We applied the Booth-Armstrong classification of the social class of a household (based on occupation) to the census data for Saltaire. This provided an overview for each census of the socio-economic variance in the village.

## Research Questions 

- To what extent does social cohesion in Saltaire differ from the patterns found in unplanned urban areas? 


- Was the model town more or less conducive to social mobility for its residents than unplanned housing?
